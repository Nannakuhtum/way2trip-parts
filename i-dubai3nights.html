After breakfast, the morning is free for you to relax. In the afternoon proceed on your Desert Safari tour.

Upon arrival at your campsite, you have the opportunity to ride on a camel, experience the thrill of sand boarding and try out a henna design on hands or feet. After all that activity you will have worked up an appetite, so enjoy a delicious BBQ dinner and a shisha (the famous Arabic water pipe). Enjoy a belly dancer performing her show around the campfire by starlight, before returning to your hotel. Overnight at your hotel in Dubai. (B, D)
