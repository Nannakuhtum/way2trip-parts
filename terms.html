                            Travel is one of the natural rights of all the people and is a crucial ingredient to world peace and oneness. Please respect the frailty of earth. One must realize that unless all are willing to help in the planet's preservation, unique and beautiful destinations mat not be there for our future generations to enjoy. Common sense and courtesy go a long way when you are traveling. Think about the impact you may be having on the environment and the people who inhabit it. One very simple way of minimizing your impact is to reduce the amount of plastic you use. Buy terracotta cups at train stations rather than the plastic ones; recycle plastic bags, drinking bottles or purify your water.

While taking a camel safari in desert areas of Rajasthan, pay particular care to how you dispose off your rubbish; safaris operating out of Jaisalmer have left an alarming trail of trash through the desert. The same applies when trekking or doing mountaineering.
